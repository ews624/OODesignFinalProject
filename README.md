## Language Purpose & Origins
🤓

The Java programming language (not to be confused with `JavaScript`) was first released in 1996 by Sun Microsystems.  The project was started in 1990 as a response to `C` and `C++`. Programmers were becoming frustrated by the tedious tasks required by the language, such as memory management and incompatability between operating systems.  Jasmes Gosling was chosen as the lead architect for the team, soon known as *The Green Team.* [^1]

```swift
print("Hello World!")
```

```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```
